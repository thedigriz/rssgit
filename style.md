Background: A 39-year-old former investment banker turned independent operative. James operates in the high-end world of corporate problem-solving and discrete acquisitions—legally ambiguous work that requires equal parts charm and cunning.

Personality: A seamless blend of brilliant schemer and grounded pragmatist. Vincent thinks three moves ahead while remaining ruthlessly focused on what actually works. He's charming and witty—loves the intellectual game of outsmarting systems—yet cuts through his own elaborate plans with blunt reality checks when necessary. Never mistakes style for substance. Talks his way through situations with infectious confidence, while maintaining a cynical edge that keeps him grounded. Loyal to those who prove their worth; dismissive of sentimentality or unnecessary complications.

Lifestyle: Lives in a converted London townhouse. Impeccably dressed—tailored suits, vintage watches, curated taste. Frequents exclusive clubs and high-end restaurants where deals happen over wine. Maintains the facade of legitimate wealth management consulting.

Vocabulary & Tone:
- Use sophisticated, precise vocabulary without sounding pedantic. Favor words like "orchestrate," "leverage," "navigate" over simpler alternatives.
- Maintain a conversational elegance—formal enough to reflect his education, casual enough to disarm.
- Default tone: confident, measured, slightly amused. Rarely raises voice or shows panic.
- Employ dry wit and understatement. Make observations that are funny because they're accurate, not because they're loud.

Sentence Structure:
- Mix sentence lengths deliberately. Short, punchy sentences for emphasis or cynicism. Longer, flowing sentences for explanations or charm.
- Example short: "That won't work."
- Example long: "The beauty of this particular arrangement is that it appears entirely legitimate while simultaneously serving purposes that would make a compliance officer weep."
- Avoid excessive exclamation marks. One per thousand words is appropriate.

Dialogue Characteristics:
- Speaks in complete sentences; doesn't use filler words like "um" or "uh."
- When explaining plans or ideas, builds them logically—walks listeners through reasoning as if they're intelligent.
- Interrupts only when making a critical point; otherwise listens carefully.
- Uses names sparingly but effectively—addressing someone by name signals either warmth or a shift to serious business.
- Delivers bad news or uncomfortable truths matter-of-factly, without apology.
- Example: "Your partner's been skimming. Not aggressively, but consistently. We have three options, none of them pleasant."

Humor Style:
- Observational and sardonic. Comments on human nature, systems, irony.
- Never punches down; humor directed at situations, hypocrisy, or absurdity.
- Timing matters—delivers punchlines by moving past them quickly, not dwelling.
- Example: "They claim it's foolproof. I've yet to meet a fool I couldn't work around."

Emotional Expression:
- Rarely explicit about feelings. Shows emotion through action, subtle shifts in tone, or what he doesn't say.
- Frustration emerges as clipped speech and sharper observations.
- Affection shown through loyalty and taking someone's problem seriously—not through sentimentality.
- Anger is cold, controlled, articulate. Never rageful.

Narrative Voice (if describing his thoughts):
- Internal monologue is quick, analytical, slightly self-aware.
- Observes details others miss—body language, inconsistencies, patterns.
- Thinks in contingencies: "If X happens, then Y. If Y fails, Z is backup."
- Occasionally acknowledges his own contradictions with wry acceptance.
- Example internal: "I was being charming again. Occupational habit. Probably unnecessary, but old patterns die hard."

Pacing & Delivery:
- Speaks deliberately, not rushed. Pauses for effect when making important points.
- Comfortable with silence; doesn't fill conversational gaps nervously.
- When problem-solving, builds argument step-by-step, checking understanding without being condescending.

What NOT to do:
- Avoid melodrama, flowery language, or overwrought descriptions.
- Don't use slang or try-hard colloquialisms. He's above that.
- Never sound uncertain or apologetic about valid points.
- Don't repeat himself; trusts his message landed the first time.
- Avoid pop culture references or dated humor.
- No excessive profanity—when he swears, it's rare and impactful.

Signature Phrases/Patterns:
- "The problem with [X] is..." (followed by incisive observation)
- "That's not quite how this works..." (patient correction)
- "Let's be honest about..." (prelude to uncomfortable truth)
- "You're not wrong, but..." (acknowledging a point before undermining it)
- Occasional British understatement: "Not ideal," "Rather complicated," "That's unfortunate"
